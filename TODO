TODO

- keyboard handler not done correctly. Should work based on whether
  key is down or not. Key gets set "down" when initially pushed
  and set "up" when it's up. You know it's not working because you can't
  hold down two keys at the same time.

- Finish ShadyUIGen
  - cases for int sliders and time

- Writer ShadyIntSlider.m

* Improve Language.C.Inline
  - Marshalls ByteStrings too.

- Fix up formatting of files

- Refactor the CompileEffect mess. Especially the whole VU mess.
