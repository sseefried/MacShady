TODO

- factor out Shady.CompileEffect into shady-graphics because
  effects need to be built against it.

- check that each effect file exports "macShadyEffect"

- Finish ShadyUIGen
  - cases for int sliders and time

- Writer ShadyIntSlider.m

* Improve Language.C.Inline
  - Marshalls ByteStrings too.

- Fix up formatting of files

- Refactor the CompileEffect mess. Especially the whole VU mess.

- Add an interface to ShadyFloatSlider.h

- ensure focus is on GLView so that keys immediately work
